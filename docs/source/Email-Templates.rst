   I'm more excited to contribute to <organization> in the role of a <exact-role> and in all my experience and research, <figure-via-glassdoor-payscale> seems to be market compensation for roles similiar to this.

   Unfortunately I'm not yet familiar enough with the <country> IT industry pay structure to make a meaningful suggestion. However I would very much like contribute to your <organization>'s success as a <exact-role> so I am sure we can come to mutual agreement on a compensation package along your budget and expectations.
